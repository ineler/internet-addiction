      <h1><u>Internet Addiction</u></h1>
      <p>
        As we know that everyone in the world using Internet like anything. They
        are highly active on
        <u>social media platforms</u>
        ,
        <u>internet surfing</u>
        ,
        <u>online gamings</u>
        , etc. Some people are addictive to use internet all the time. This
        addiction is dragging them to be engaged all the time in
        <u>some sort of online activity</u>
        . And this behaviour is considered as
        <u class="upUnder"><b>internet addiction</b></u>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        I am pretty sure, there must be some question which are coming across to
        your mind. I will try to resolve them in the
        <u>"Information"</u>
        and
        <u>"Know and Reduce it"</u>
        section.
